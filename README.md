# DrivenData Competitions

This repository acts as the center point for any competition enter hosted on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/). Competitions on this site are usually more difficult than others, and often require special infrastructure setup to compete. The user forums are also not nearly as active as Kaggle's which compounds these competitions into the most challenging I've participated in.
