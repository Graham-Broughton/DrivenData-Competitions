# DrivenData Competitions

## Overview

This repository acts as the center point for any competition enter hosted on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/). Competitions on this site are much more challenging than others. Not only is the material more advanced, but they often require particular file structure for execution and massive amounts of memory and compute power to compete. The user forums are also not nearly as active as Kaggle's which further compounds the difficulty making these competitions the most challenging I've participated in.
